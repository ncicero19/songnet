These are the requirements to run tonnetz.py. You have to open a virtual environment 
by navigating to songnet/db and then running: 
-- python3.11 -m venv venv 
-- source venv/bin/activate 
then you have to pip install the following packages (python can be ignored if you run python3.11 -m venv venv)


python==3.11
essentia
numpy==1.26.4

then you can run python3.11 tonnetz.py
